  Fresh has built-in support for serving static files. This is useful for serving images, CSS, and other static assets.
---

Fresh automatically serves static assets placed in a `static/` directory in the
project root. These assets are served at the root of the webserver, with a
higher priority than routes. This means that if a given request matches a file
in the `static/` folder, it is always served, even if there is a route that
would also match the request.

Static asset responses automatically get a `content-type` header assigned based
on the file extension of the file on disk. Assets are also automatically
streamed from disk to the client to improve performance and efficiency for both
user and server.

Fresh also adds an `etag` header to assets automatically and handles the
`If-None-Match` header for incoming requests.

### Caching

By default, no caching headers are added to assets. This can be disadvantageous
in many scenarios, so Fresh makes it easy to serve assets with long cache
lifetimes too.

The first approach to do this is manual. The client runtime exports an `asset`
function that takes an absolute path to the static asset and returns a "locked"
version of this path that contains a build ID for cache busting. When the asset
is requested at this "locked" path, it will be served with a cache lifetime of
one year.

```tsx routes/page.tsx
import { asset } from "$fresh/runtime.ts";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <p>
      <a href={asset("/brochure.pdf")}>View brochure</a>
    </p>
  );
}
```

Fresh also does this automatically for `src` and `srcset` attributes in `<img>`
and `<source>` HTML tags. These will automatically use "locked" paths if Fresh
deems it safe to do so. You can always opt out of this behaviour per tag, by
adding the `data-fresh-disable-lock` attribute.

```tsx routes/user.tsx
{/* Locked URL source */}
<img src="/user.png" />;

{/* Preserve URL source and disable lock */}
<img src="/user.png" data-fresh-disable-lock />;
```
