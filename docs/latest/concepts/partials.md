  Partials allow areas of a page to be updated without causing the browser to reload the page. They enable optimized fine grained UI updates and can be used to do client-side navigation.

Partials allow areas of the page to be updated with new content by the server
without causing the browser to reload the page. They make your website feel more
app-like because only the parts of the page that need to be updated will
updated.

## Enabling partials

Partials are enabled by adding a `f-client-nav` attribute to an HTML element and
wrapping one or more areas in the page with a
`<Partial name="my-partial">`-component.

The quickest way to get started is to enable partials for every page in
`routes/_app.tsx` by making the following changes.

```diff routes/_app.tsx
  import { AppProps } from "$fresh/server.ts";
+ import { Partial } from "$fresh/runtime.ts";

  export default function App({ Component }: AppProps) {
    return (
      <html>
        <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8" />
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
          <title>My Fresh app</title>
        </head>
-       <body>
+       <body f-client-nav>
+         <Partial name="body">
            <Component />
+         </Partial>
        </body>
      </html>
    );
  }
```

By adding the `f-client-nav` attribute, we enable partials for every element
beneath the `<body>`-tag. To mark an area of the page as a partial we wrap it
with a `<Partial>`-component with a unique name.

Behind the scenes, when the user clicks an `<a>`-tag, Fresh fetches the new page
and only pulls out the relevant content out of the HTML response. When it finds
a matching partial area it will update the content inside the partial.

> [info]: The `name` prop of the `<Partial>` component is expected to be unique
> among Partials. That's how Fresh knows which parts of the response need to go
> on the current page.

> [info]: Passing `f-client-nav={false}` disables client side navigation for all
> elements below the current node.

### Optimizing partial requests

By default, with `f-client-nav` set, Fresh fetches the full next page and only
picks out the relevant parts of the response. We can optimize this pattern
further by only rendering the parts we need, instead of always rendering the
full page. This is done by adding the `f-partial` attribute to a link.

```diff
- <a href="/docs/routes">Routes</a>
+ <a href="/docs/routes" f-partial="/partials/docs/routes">Routes</a>
```

When the `f-partial` attribute is present, Fresh will navigate to the page URL
defined in the `href` attribute, but fetch the updated UI from the URL specified
in `f-partial` instead. This can be a highly optimized route that only delivers
the content you care about.

Let's use a typical documentation page layout as an example. It often features a
main content area and a sidebar of links to switch between pages of the
documentation (marked green here).

![A sketched layout of a typical documentation page with the sidebar on the left composed of green links and a main content area on the right. The main content area is labeled as Partial "docs-content"](/docs/fresh-partial-docs.png)

The code for such a page (excluding styling) might look like this:

```tsx routes/docs/[id].tsx
export default defineRoute(async (req, ctx) => {
  const content = await loadContent(props.params.id);

  return (
    <div>
      <aside>
        <a href="/docs/page1">Page 1</a>
        <a href="/docs/page2">Page 2</a>
      </aside>
      <Partial name="docs-content">
        {content}
      </Partial>
    </div>
  );
});
```

An optimal route that only renders the content instead of the outer layout with
the sidebar might look like this respectively.

```tsx routes/partials/docs/[id].tsx
import { defineRoute, RouteConfig } from "$fresh/server.ts";
import { Partial } from "$fresh/runtime.ts";

// We only want to render the content, so disable
// the `_app.tsx` template as well as any potentially
// inherited layouts
export const config: RouteConfig = {
  skipAppWrapper: true,
  skipInheritedLayouts: true,
};

export default defineRoute(async (req, ctx) => {
  const content = await loadContent(props.params.id);

  // Only render the new content
  return (
    <Partial name="docs-content">
      {content}
    </Partial>
  );
});
```

By adding the `f-partial` attribute we tell Fresh to fetch the content from our
newly added `/partials/docs/[id].tsx` route.

```diff routes/docs/[id].tsx
  <aside>
-   <a href="/docs/page1">Page 1</a>
-   <a href="/docs/page2">Page 2</a>
+   <a href="/docs/page1" f-partial="/partials/docs/page1">Page 1</a>
+   <a href="/docs/page2" f-partial="/partials/docs/page2">Page 2</a>
  </aside>
```

With this in place, Fresh will navigate to the new page when clicking any of the
two links and _only_ load the content rendered by our optimized partial route.

> Currently, `f-partial` is scoped to `<a>`, `<button>` and `<form>` elements.
> This might be extended to more elements in the future.

## Sending multiple Partials at the same time

A neat aspect of partials in Fresh is that a response can return as many
partials as desired. That way you can update multiple unrelated areas on your
page in one single HTTP response. A scenario where this is useful are online
shops for example.

```tsx routes/partials/cart.tsx
export default function AddToCartPartial() {
  return (
    <>
      <Partial name="cart-items" mode="append">
        {/* Render the new cart item here */}
      </Partial>
      <Partial name="total-price">
        <p>Total: {totalPrice} €</p>
      </Partial>
    </>
  );
}
```

Both partials will be applied to the current page.

## Replacement mode

By default the whole content inside a partial will be replaced, but there are
scenarios where you want to prepend or append new content instead. This can be
achieved by adding the `mode` prop to a `Partial` component.

- `replace` - Swap out the content of the existing partial (default)
- `prepend` - Insert the new content before the existing content
- `append` - Insert the new content after the existing content

Personally, we’ve found that the `append` mode is really useful when you have an
UI which displays log messages or similar list-like data.

```tsx
export default function LogView() {
  const lines = getNewLogLines();

  return (
    <Partial name="logs-list" mode="append">
      {lines.map((line) => {
        return <li key={line}>{line}</li>;
      })}
    </Partial>
  );
}
```

> [info]: When picking the `prepend` or `append` mode, make sure to add keys to
> the elements.
