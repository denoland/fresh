  Style active links with ease in Fresh
---

Fresh automatically enhances the accessibility of `<a>` elements by adding the
aria-current attribute when rendering links that match the current URL. This
attribute is recognized by assistive technologies and clearly indicates the
current page within a set of pages.

- aria-current="page" - Added to links with an exact path match, enhancing
  accessibility by indicating the current page to assistive technologies.

As we aim to improve accessibility, we encourage the use of aria-current for
styling current links where applicable.

## Styling with CSS

The aria-current attribute is easily styled with CSS using attribute selectors,
providing a native way to visually differentiate the active link.

```css
/* Give links pointing to the current page a green color */
a[aria-current="page"] {
  color: green;
}

/* Color all ancestor links of the current page */
a[aria-current="true"] {
  color: peachpuff;
}
```

## Tailwind / Twind

In Tailwind or similar CSS frameworks like Twind, you can apply styles to
elements with the ï»¿aria-current attribute using bracket notation in your class
definitions. However, the specific syntax varies slightly between Tailwind and
Twind. For Tailwind, use the syntax:

```tsx
function Menu() {
  return (
    <a href="/foo" class="aria-[current]:text-green-600">
      Link to some page
    </a>
  );
}
```

For Twind, the syntax is:

```tsx
function Menu() {
  return (
    <a href="/foo" class="[aria-current]:text-green-600">
      Link to some page
    </a>
  );
}
```

### Twind Plugin

The original twind plugin (`import twindPlugin from "$fresh/plugins/twind.ts";`)
supports the above style:

```tsx
class="[aria-current='page']:text-green-600"
```

### TwindV1 Plugin

The new twind plugin (`import twindPlugin from "$fresh/plugins/twindv1.ts";`)
requires a slightly different syntax (note the position of the left bracket):

```tsx
class="aria-[current='page']:text-green-600"
```
