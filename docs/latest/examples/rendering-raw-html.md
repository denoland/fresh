  How to render raw HTML in Fresh.
---

Text content in Fresh is always escaped, whether serverside rendered or rendered
in islands. While this generally desired, it can create issues in certain
situations.

To address this you can render raw HTML via Preact's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
prop:

```tsx routes/dynamic-html.tsx
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "<h1>This is raw HTML</h1>" }} />;
```

This will output:

```html Response body
<div>
  <h1>This is raw HTML</h1>
</div>
```

A common use case for rendering raw HTML is syntax highlighting code blocks or
rendering markdown.
