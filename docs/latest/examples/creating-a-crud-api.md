  Use HTTP CRUD methods to perform operations on resources. Learn how to use HTTP handlers to create a RESTful API.
---

The MDN [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) are a
great resource to learn more about HTTP methods. We'll touch on the four
fundamental methods necessary to create a basic CRUD (create, read, update,
delete) API here. Additionally, we'll briefly mention CORS requests and how
`OPTIONS` comes into play.

Using HTTP methods is a common way to create a REST API. Fresh supports common
HTTP methods in handlers out of the box. Async HTTP requests are also supported.
Read more about custom handlers [here](/docs/getting-started/custom-handlers).

In this example we'll be creating a small API that uses
[Deno KV](https://deno.com/kv) to store users in a database.

Our project structure will look like this (in addition to the rest of the Fresh
code from a new project):

```txt-files Project Structure
<project root>
└── routes
    └── api
        └── users
            ├── [id].ts
            └── index.ts
```

In each section about a method, only the relevant handler will be shown. The
full files are available at the bottom for reference.

## POST

`POST` (create) is used to create a resource.

```tsx routes/api/users/index.ts
export const handler: Handlers<User | null> = {
  async POST(req, _ctx) {
    const user = (await req.json()) as User;
    const userKey = ["user", user.id];
    const ok = await kv.atomic().set(userKey, user).commit();
    if (!ok) throw new Error("Something went wrong.");
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(user));
  },
};
```

Test this with Postman (or your favorite client) with a URL like
`http://localhost:8000/api/users` and a method of `POST`. Make sure to have a
payload like:

```json Request body
{
  "id": "2",
  "name": "TestUserName"
}
```

You should receive the same thing back:

```json Response body
{ "id": "2", "name": "TestUserName" }
```

## GET

`GET` (read) is used to retrieve a resource and is by far the most common HTTP
method. You can use `GET` to fetch database content, markdown, or static files.

```tsx routes/api/users/[id].ts
export const handler: Handlers<User | null> = {
  async GET(_req, ctx) {
    const id = ctx.params.id;
    const key = ["user", id];
    const user = (await kv.get<User>(key)).value!;
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(user));
  },
};
```

Let's practice retrieving our user! A `GET` request to
`http://localhost:8000/api/users/2` should return:

```json Response body
{ "id": "2", "name": "TestUserName" }
```

## PUT (and PATCH)

`PUT` (update) and `PATCH` are used to update a resource. While similar, there
are differences and you should use the one that best suits your use case. Read
more about HTTP methods on
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

The short version of it: `PUT` requires the entire object to be submitted, while
`PATCH` requires only the properties that are different to be submitted.

An example of an update endpoint using `PUT`:

```tsx routes/api/users/[id].ts
export const handler: Handlers<User | null> = {
  async PUT(req, ctx) {
    const id = ctx.params.id;
    const user = (await req.json()) as User;
    const userKey = ["user", id];
    const userRes = await kv.get(userKey);
    if (!userRes.value) return new Response(`no user with id ${id} found`);
    const ok = await kv.atomic().check(userRes).set(userKey, user).commit();
    if (!ok) throw new Error("Something went wrong.");
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(user));
  },
};
```

Time to change their name. We'll now `PUT` a request to
`http://localhost:8000/api/users/2` like:

```json Request body
{
  "id": "2",
  "name": "New Name"
}
```

We should receive:

```json Response body
{ "id": "2", "name": "New Name" }
```

If, on the other hand, we chose to implement this as a `PATCH` operation, the
request would just involve the changed property like this:

```json Response body
{
  "name": "New Name"
}
```

No need to send in the id in this case.

## DELETE

`DELETE` (delete) is used to delete a resource.

```tsx routes/api/users/[id].ts
export const handler: Handlers<User | null> = {
  async DELETE(_req, ctx) {
    const id = ctx.params.id;
    const userKey = ["user", id];
    const userRes = await kv.get(userKey);
    if (!userRes.value) return new Response(`no user with id ${id} found`);
    const ok = await kv.atomic().check(userRes).delete(userKey).commit();
    if (!ok) throw new Error("Something went wrong.");
    return new Response(`user ${id} deleted`);
  },
};
```

Try sending `DELETE` to `http://localhost:8000/api/users/2` without a body.
We'll get back:

```txt Response body
user 2 deleted
```

## OPTIONS

Options can be used for some advanced cases, including implementing preflight
request checks for complex CORS use cases. See more on the
[CORS documentation](/docs/examples/dealing-with-cors).
