description: "Restrict access by IP address with the ipFilter middleware"
---

The `ipFilter()` middleware restricts access based on the client's IP address.
It supports deny lists, allow lists, and CIDR subnet matching. Deny rules always
take precedence over allow rules.

```ts main.ts
import { App, ipFilter } from "fresh";

const app = new App()
  .use(ipFilter({
    denyList: ["192.168.1.10", "10.0.0.0/8"],
    allowList: ["192.168.1.0/24"],
  }))
  .get("/", () => new Response("hello"));
```

## Deny list

Block specific IPs or subnets. Any request from a matching address receives a
403 Forbidden response:

```ts main.ts
import { App, ipFilter } from "fresh";

const app = new App()
  .use(ipFilter({
    denyList: ["192.168.1.10", "2001:db8::1", "10.0.0.0/8"],
  }));
```

## Allow list

When an allow list is provided, only matching IPs are permitted. All other
addresses are blocked:

```ts main.ts
import { App, ipFilter } from "fresh";

const app = new App()
  .use(ipFilter({
    allowList: ["203.0.113.0/24", "2001:db8::/32"],
  }));
```

## Combined rules

When both lists are provided, deny rules are checked first. An IP that appears
in both lists is blocked:

```ts main.ts
import { App, ipFilter } from "fresh";

const app = new App()
  .use(ipFilter({
    denyList: ["192.168.1.10"],
    allowList: ["192.168.1.0/24"],
  }));
```

In this example, all of `192.168.1.0/24` is allowed except `192.168.1.10`.

## Custom blocked response

By default, blocked requests receive a `403 Forbidden` response. Use the
`onBlocked` callback to customize this:

```ts main.ts
import { App, ipFilter } from "fresh";

const app = new App()
  .use(ipFilter({
    denyList: ["10.0.0.0/8"],
  }, {
    onBlocked: (remote, ctx) => {
      console.log(`Blocked ${remote.addr} from ${ctx.url.pathname}`);
      return new Response("Access denied", { status: 401 });
    },
  }));
```

The `onBlocked` callback receives:

- `remote.addr` -- the client's IP address
- `remote.type` -- `"IPv4"` or `"IPv6"`
- `ctx` -- the request [context](/docs/concepts/context)
