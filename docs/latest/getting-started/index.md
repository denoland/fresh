In this chapter of the Fresh documentation, you'll be introduced to the
framework. You'll learn how to create a new project, run it locally, edit and
create pages, fetch data, handle user interactions, and how to then deploy the
project to [Deno Deploy][deno-deploy].

The documentation assumes you have Deno 1.45.2 or later installed.

To install Deno, follow the
[installation instructions in the Deno manual][manual-installation].

For the best user experience, you should also set up your editor or IDE to play
nice with Deno. Documentation for this can also be found
[in the manual][manual-editors].
