In this chapter of the Fresh documentation, you'll be introduced to the
framework. You'll learn how to create a new project, run it locally, edit and
create pages, fetch data, handle user interactions, and how to then deploy the
project to [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

The documentation assumes you have the latest version
[Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/#install-deno) installed on your system and
set up your
[Editor to work with Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/setup_your_environment/).
