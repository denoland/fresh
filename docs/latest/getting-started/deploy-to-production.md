  Deploy a Fresh application to Deno Deploy in seconds, making it available on
  the edge globally - resulting in fantastic user latency worldwide.
---

As a final step in the getting started guide, we'll deploy the demo site to the
public internet using [Deno Deploy][deno-deploy]. Deno Deploy is a globally
distributed edge runtime built by the Deno company that allows developers to
quickly and painlessly deploy web applications to the internet. Deno Deploy has
edge nodes all over the world that serve traffic. Because of this, users
worldwide have fantastic latency because their traffic is served from a server
that is physically close to them.

To deploy to Deno Deploy, we'll make use of the GitHub integration. To use this
the code needs to be pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once this has been done,
one must go to the [Deno Deploy dashboard][deno-deploy-dashboard] and create a
new project.

Click on the "New Project" button and select the GitHub repository that contains
the Fresh project. Select the "Fresh" framework preset, and click on "Advanced
options". Enter `deno run build` in the "Build command" field. Press "Create
project".

The project will now deploy to Deno Deploy. After this is done, the project will
be available at https://$PROJECT_NAME.deno.dev.

Every time the code in the GitHub repository is updated, it will be deployed
either as a preview or production deployment. Production deployments are only
created for changes to the default/production branch (often `main`).
