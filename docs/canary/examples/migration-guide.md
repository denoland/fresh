  Migration guide for Fresh 2.x
---

We tried to keep breaking changes in Fresh 2 as minimal as possible, but some
changes need to be updated manually. Fresh 2 comes with many quality of life
[improvements](https://deno.com/blog/an-update-on-fresh) that make it easier to
extend and adapt Fresh. We've created this upgrade guide as part of upgrading
our own apps here at Deno.

Use this guide to migrate a Fresh 1.x app to Fresh 2.

## Applying automatic updates

Most changes can be applied automatically with the update script. Start the
update by running it in your project directory:

```sh Terminal
deno run -Ar jsr:@fresh/update
```

This will apply most API changes made in Fresh 2 automatically update like
changing `$fresh/server.ts` imports to `fresh`.

## Getting `main.ts` and `dev.ts` ready

Configuring Fresh doesn't require a dedicated config file anymore. You can
delete the `fresh.config.ts` file. The `fresh.gen.ts` manifest file isn't needed
anymore either.

```diff Project structure
  <project root>
  ├── routes/
- ├── dev.ts
- ├── fresh.gen.ts
- ├── fresh.config.ts
  └── main.ts
```

Fresh 2 takes great care in ensuring that code that's only needed during
development is separate from production code. This split makes deployments much
smaller, quicker to upload and allows them to boot up much quicker in
production.

### Replacing `dev.ts` with `vite.config.ts`

Delete `dev.ts` and create a `vite.config.ts` file instead. Pass your custom
Fresh configuration to the [fresh vite plugin](/docs/canary/advanced/vite).

```ts vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { fresh } from "@fresh/plugin-vite";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    fresh(),
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
});
```

### Add a `client.ts` file

The `client.ts` file is the main entry file for client-side code. Since vite
requires everything to be part of the internal module graph to get hot module
reloading to work, this is also the place where you import CSS assets.

```diff Project structure
  <project root>
  ├── routes/
+ ├── client.ts
  ├── vite.config.ts
  └── main.ts
```

```ts client.ts
// Import CSS files here for hot module reloading to work.
import "./assets/styles.css";
```

### Updating `main.ts`

Similarly, configuration related to running Fresh in production can be passed to
`new App()`:

```ts main.ts
import { App, staticFiles } from "fresh";

export const app = new App()
  // Add static file serving middleware
  .use(staticFiles())
  // Enable file-system based routing
  .fsRoutes();
```

## Merging error pages

Both the `_500.tsx` and `_404.tsx` template have been unified into a single
`_error.tsx` template.

```diff Project structure
  └── <root>/routes/
-     ├── _404.tsx
-     ├── _500.tsx
+     ├── _error.tsx
      └── ...
```

Inside the `_error.tsx` template you can show different content based on errors
or status codes with the following code:

```tsx routes/_error.tsx
export default function ErrorPage(props: PageProps) {
  const error = props.error; // Contains the thrown Error or HTTPError
  if (error instanceof HttpError) {
    const status = error.status; // HTTP status code

    // Render a 404 not found page
    if (status === 404) {
      return <h1>404 - Page not found</h1>;
    }
  }

  return <h1>Oh no...</h1>;
}
```

## Updating tasks

The server entrypoint is now generated by Fresh for more optimal startup times.
This means you need to update your task when launching Fresh in production mode.

To launch Fresh in production mode:

```diff
- deno run -A main.ts
+ deno serve -A _fresh/server.js
```

You'll likely have that command inside your `deno.json` as a task. Update it
accordingly.

```diff deno.json
  {
    "tasks":
-     "dev": "deno run -A dev.ts",
-     "build": "deno run -A dev.ts build",
-     "preview": "deno run -A main.ts"
+     "dev": "vite",
+     "build": "vite build",
+     "preview": "deno serve -A _fresh/server.js"
   }
  }
```

## Update deployment settings

Fresh 2 requires assets to be build during deployment instead of building them
on demand. Run the `deno task build` command as part of your deployment process.
If you have already set up Fresh's 1.x "Ahead-of-Time Builds", then no changes
are necessary.

## Trailing slash handling

The handling trailing slashes has been extracted to an optional middleware that
you can add if needed. This middleware can be used to ensure that URLs always
have a trailing slash at the end or that they will never have one.

```diff main.ts
-  import { App, staticFiles } from "fresh";
+  import { App, staticFiles, trailingSlashes } from "fresh";

  export const app = new App({ root: import.meta.url })
    .use(staticFiles())
+   .use(trailingSlashes("never"));
```

## Automatic updates

> [info]: The changes listed here are applied automatically when running the
> [`@fresh/update`](https://jsr.io/@fresh/update) script and you shouldn't need
> to have to do these yourself.

### Unified middleware signatures

Middleware, handler and route component signatures have been unified to all look
the same. Instead of receiving two arguments, they receive one. The `Request`
object is stored on the context object as `ctx.request`.

```diff middleware.ts
- const middleware = (req, ctx) => new Response("ok");
+ const middleware = (ctx) => new Response("ok");
```

Same is true for handlers:

```diff route/page.tsx
  export const handler = {
-   GET(req, ctx) {
+   GET(ctx) {
      return new Response("ok");
    },
  };
```

...and async route components:

```diff routes/my-page.tsx
-  export default async function MyPage(req: Request, ctx: RouteContext) {
+  export default async function MyPage(props: PageProps) {
    const value = await loadFooValue();
    return <p>foo is: {value}</p>;
  }
```

All the various context interfaces have been consolidated and simplified:

| Fresh 1.x                                     | Fresh 2.x                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `AppContext`, `LayoutContext`, `RouteContext` | [`Context`](/docs/canary/concepts/context) |

### Context methods

The `ctx.renderNotFound()` method has been removed in favor of throwing an
`HttpError` instance. This allows all middlewares to optionally participate in
error handling. Other properties have been moved or renamed to make it easier to
re-use existing objects internally as a minor performance optimization.

| Fresh 1.x              | Fresh 2.x                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `ctx.renderNotFound()` | `throw new HttpError(404)` |
| `ctx.basePath`         | `ctx.config.basePath`      |
| `ctx.remoteAddr`       | `ctx.info.remoteAddr`      |

## `createHandler`

The `createHandler` function was often used to launch Fresh for tests. This can
be now done via vite's `createBuilder` function. See the
[testing page](/docs/canary/testing) for more information.
