  Create a new fresh project by running `fresh init`. This scaffolds out the
  various files and folders a fresh project needs.
---

New `fresh` projects can be created with the `fresh` CLI tool. It will scaffold
out a new project with some example files to get you started.

To create a new project in the directory `"my-project"`, run:

```
$ fresh init my-project
Manifest generated and written to ./my-project/fresh.gen.ts
```

This will create a directory containing a bunch of files. Out of all of the
files, only two are strictly necessary for a fresh project:

- **`main.ts`**: This is the entrypoint for your project. It is the file that
  will you run to start your fresh application. This file doesn't actually need
  to be called `main.ts`, but it's best practice to call the entrypoint
  `main.ts`.
- **`fresh.gen.ts`**: This is the manifest file that contains information about
  your routes and islands. This file is automatically generated based on your
  `routes/` and `islands/` folder by the `fresh` CLI when running the
  `fresh manifest` command.

In addition to these two files, two other files are created that manage
dependencies:

- **`client_deps.ts`**: This file contains dependencies that you need on the
  client, and possibly also on the server. It should be assumed that all of the
  dependencies referenced by this file will be shipped to the client. By
  default, it just re-exports the `fresh` runtime.
- **`server_deps.ts`**: This file contains dependencies that are only used on
  the server. These are often things like database drivers, API clients, or
  other code that should only be executed on the server. This file should never
  be referenced by modules that might be shipped to the client. By default this
  just re-exports the `fresh` server libraries.

Two important folders are also created that contain your routes and islands
respectively:

- **`routes/`**: This folder contains all of the routes in your project. The
  names of each file in this folder corresponds to the path where that page will
  be accessed. Code inside of this folder is never directly shipped to the
  client. You'll learn more about how routes work in the next section.
- **`islands/`**: This folder contains all of the interactive islands in your
  project. The name of each file corresponds to the name of the island defined
  in that file. Code inside of this folder can be run from both client and
  server. You'll learn more about islands later in this chapter.

Finally a **`static/`** folder is created that contains static files that are
automatically served "as is". [Learn more about static files][static-files].
