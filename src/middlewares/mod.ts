/**
 * A middleware function is the basic building block of Fresh. It allows you
 * to respond to an incoming request in any way you want. You can redirect
 * routes, serve files, create APIs and much more. Middlewares can be chained by
 * calling {@linkcode FreshContext.next|ctx.next()} inside of the function.
 *
 * Middlewares can be synchronous or asynchronous. If a middleware returns a
 * {@linkcode Response} object, the response will be sent back to the client. If
 * a middleware returns a `Promise<Response>`, Fresh will wait for the promise
 * to resolve before sending the response.
 *
 * A {@linkcode FreshContext} object is passed to the middleware function. This
 * object contains the original request object, as well as any state related to
 * the current request. The context object also contains methods to redirect
 * the client to another URL, or to call the next middleware in the chain.
 *
 * Middlewares can be defined as a single function or an array of functions.
 * When an array of middlewares is passed to
 * {@linkcode _App.prototype.use|app.use}, Fresh will call each middleware in the
 * order they are defined.
 *
 * Middlewares can also be defined using the
 * {@linkcode _Define.middleware|define.middleware} method. This
 * method is optional, but it can be useful for type checking and code
 * completion. It does not register the middleware with the app.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ### Logging middleware
 *
 * This example shows how to create a simple middleware that logs incoming
 * requests.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // Define a middleware function that logs incoming requests. Using the
 * // `define.middleware` method is optional, but it can be useful for type
 * // checking and code completion. It does not register the middleware with the
 * // app.
 * const loggerMiddleware = define.middleware((ctx) => {
 *   console.log(`${ctx.req.method} ${ctx.req.url}`);
 *   // Call the next middleware
 *   return ctx.next();
 * });
 *
 * // To register the middleware to the app, use `app.use`.
 * app.use(loggerMiddleware)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Redirect middleware
 *
 * This example shows how to create a middleware that redirects requests from
 * one URL to another.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // Any request to a URL that starts with "/legacy/" will be redirected to
 * // "/modern".
 * const redirectMiddleware = define.middleware((ctx) => {
 *   if (ctx.url.pathname.startsWith("/legacy/")) {
 *     return ctx.redirect("/modern");
 *   }
 *
 *   // Otherwise call the next middleware
 *   return ctx.next();
 * });
 *
 * // Again, register the middleware with the app.
 * app.use(redirectMiddleware);
 * ```
